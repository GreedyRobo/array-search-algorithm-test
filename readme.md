# Array Search Algorithms in JavaScript

Implemented Algorithms:

#### Linear Search
Time Complexity: O(n)  
Description: Linear search involves iterating through each element in the array until the target element is found or the end of the array is reached.

#### Binary Search 

Time Complexity: O(log n)  
Description: Binary search requires the array to be sorted. It repeatedly divides the search interval in half until the target element is found or the interval is empty.
